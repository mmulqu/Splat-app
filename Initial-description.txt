This is a really practical project idea! Here’s how I’d approach implementing it:

## Core Architecture

**Mobile App → Cloudflare Workers API → Processing Service → R2 Storage → Mobile Viewer**

## Technology Choices

**Go with Gaussian Splatting over NeRF** - it’s much faster to train (minutes vs hours), smaller file sizes, and easier to render on mobile devices. Specifically, I’d recommend **3D Gaussian Splatting** using implementations like:

- `nerfstudio` (has gaussian splatting support)
- `gaussian-splatting` (original INRIA implementation)

## Concrete Implementation Plan

### 1. **Mobile App** (React Native or Flutter)

- Camera interface for multi-angle photo capture (guide users to get good coverage)
- Upload photos to R2 via signed URLs
- 3D viewer using Three.js wrapper (react-three-fiber for RN)

### 2. **Cloudflare Backend**

```
- Workers: API endpoints for upload/processing requests
- R2: Store photos + resulting .ply/.splat files
- D1: Track reconstruction jobs, metadata
- Queue: Job queue for processing requests
```

### 3. **Processing Service** (the tricky part)

Since Gaussian Splatting needs GPU, you have options:

**Option A - Hybrid approach (recommended for free credits):**

- Use Cloudflare Workers to orchestrate
- Trigger external GPU service (Replicate, Modal, or RunPod) via API
- These charge per-use but are affordable ($0.50-2 per reconstruction)

**Option B - Self-hosted:**

- Small GPU server (Lambda Labs, [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai))
- Poll Cloudflare Queue for jobs
- More control but ongoing costs

### 4. **Viewer**

Use existing Gaussian Splatting viewers:

- **antimatter15/splat** - WebGL viewer, works great on mobile
- **playcanvas/supersplat** - another good web option
- Embed in WebView or use three.js directly

## Sample Workflow

```javascript
// Worker API endpoint
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    if (request.url.includes('/upload')) {
      // 1. Generate signed R2 URLs for photo upload
      // 2. Create job entry in D1
      // 3. Return upload URLs to app
    }
    
    if (request.url.includes('/process')) {
      // 1. Trigger processing (Modal/Replicate API)
      // 2. Processing service downloads from R2
      // 3. Runs gaussian splatting
      // 4. Uploads .ply back to R2
      // 5. Updates D1 job status
    }
    
    if (request.url.includes('/view')) {
      // Return R2 URL for .ply file
    }
  }
}
```

## Minimal Viable Version

Start simple:

1. **Week 1:** Basic React Native app that captures 20-30 photos and uploads to R2
1. **Week 2:** Cloudflare Worker that triggers Modal/Replicate API for processing
1. **Week 3:** Integrate splat viewer (use existing web viewer in WebView initially)
1. **Week 4:** Polish UX, add project management (list of scanned objects)

## Processing Cost Reality Check

- Each reconstruction: ~$0.50-2 (depending on photo count)
- Your free Cloudflare credits cover storage/API easily
- You’d need separate budget for GPU processing OR run on your own GPU

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part? I can also help draft the actual Cloudflare Worker code or mobile app structure if you want to get started.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
